# Ride On Way

Ride On Way is a web-based application that allows regular commuters to request and offer rides, reducing travel expenses by sharing rides with others traveling along the same route. Unlike traditional ride-sharing apps like Uber and Lyft, Ride On Way lets registered users offer rides on their regular commute routes, specifying predefined locations they are traveling to and from, available seats, ride cost per passenger, and time slots.

## Vision Statement

For regular commuters who always travel on the same route consistently every day and want to reduce their travel expenses, Ride On Way is a web-based application that allows users who are traveling from one location to another to request a ride and also offer a ride and drop off the person on the way. Unlike applications such as Uber and Lyft, our application lets a person who has registered to offer a ride on the way, providing a predefined location they are traveling to (like Denton to Frisco, Plano to Irving). Since having a shared ride all the time it will always cost a very minimal amount to the user. Users can specify their preferred time slot, providing multiple rider options to choose from. So, when the selected person confirms the ride for that exact location, the ride will be confirmed.
